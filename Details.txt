Topics:

  1. Express Router:
      Separate & Modularise the API logics using router

      instead of dumping all the API logics in one single file
  
  2. Create APIs for the sample questions below,

      1. Assigning a teacher to a student,
          This should relate the students and teacher

        Using PUT Request to assign a teacher to a student

      2. Get all the students for a specific teacher

          Write a query param ( teacherId  ) in the get all students,
            then send only the students associated only with that teacherId
          
          No TeacherId found, send all the students

      3. Get the Teacher info for a specific student

  3. DB Connection ---> MongoDB 

    Step 1:
      Connection to a DB
    Step 2: 
      Write Queries to do CRUD opertion with DB

    to connect to any DB We need driver setup for any language

    Packages:
      MongoDB -> Simple Connecting to DB and writing ontop of the database
    
  4. Converting the Local variable to Local DB
        local memory storing will loose the data after server restart

        but local DB Data will be persisted locally in the machine - Done

  5. Cloud DB:
      1. Cloud Atlas:

        Signing Up & Creating Cloud DB

        Connecting with Cloud Atlas DB
      
        DB Create: 
          1. Sign up on https://cloud.mongodb.com/
          2. Cluster Creation
          3. Database Creation ( Select M0 Free Version & Create )
          4. Username with Password, Note those details somewhere safe
          5. Add 0.0.0.0/0 in the network - this open up the db for anybody with username/password to connect to it
          5. Copy the Connect URL and replace with the local url

              mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.ruapl1v.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

              mongodb+srv://sanjaysaravanan00007:<password>@cluster0.yxr2hty.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
      
    Cloud Backend ( NodeJs in Render.com ) <-> Cloud DB ( Mongo Cluster )
        
Next Session:
  Mongoose:

    what is mongoose?
      schema based object modelling tool for connecting & doing CRUD operation on DB

    schema

    DB Connection:
      URI string to identify the database service

Tasks:

  Day 34: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwPQ2LbHtMZajA_GIZfR-Ko2MFueoT82AmfHTK9V-hM/edit ( local variables to store data )

  Day 35: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxHk2QDyK_evjlbwWPklyTXDHHOENKqj-IHS2yNSaHQ/edit

  Create two Object:
    mentor:
      name
      email
      mentorId
      // students array contains student ids
      students: [ 'Gokulnath-1234', 'Namrata-5678' ]

    mentor-assignment:
      studentId
      mentorId
      assignmentId

    student:
      name
      email
      studentId
      currentMentor: 'Sanjay S'
      prevMentor: 'Sanjay Prashanth' ( once You assign a mentor to a student change the current & prev mentor accordingly )

    Try to complete in local setup, will teach to deploy the complete setup to cloud tomorrow
